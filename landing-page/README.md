# udacity-landing-page-project
This is my submitted project in the FWD scholarship 2022 ( Professional Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program )

It was my 1st time to create such an orgnaised thing from A to Z, I was given an HTML page with a this Rubric as a guide to finish it:



Started by linking app.js.

Build out HTML and at least 4 content sections.

Created a navigation menu dynamicly

Created NAV bar inside the menu to store the data structure 

A NavBarList list was created goes over the data structure ( Link to Section Number )

Use YourActiveClass class to get the active class for the section number

ActiveLink class was added in the CSS file to activate the list link

Added the functionality to scroll to sections through ScrollTo

# With mouse click I added smooth to create a simple animation while page scroll +
# Header will be hiden within 5sec if the page not scrolling +
# A to top button with a arrow-forward.svg in page footer.
